## How to make paragraphs

To make __paragraphs__ in HTML, use the `p` tag.

Example:

```html
<p>Your text here</p>
```

## How to make headers

To make __headers__ in HTML, there are several tags. There is `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, and `h6`. The reason there are so many tags is because of the size difference. `h1` is the largest and `h6` is the smallest.

Examples:

```html
<h1>Your text here</h1>
<!-- You can swap out 'h1' with the other tags to make this smaller -->
```
