## How to make links

To make __links__ in HTML, use the `a` tag. You would use this with the `href` attribute. The `href` attribute specifies where you want the link to go.

Example:

```html
<a href="your link here">Your text here</a>
```

Links will automatically open in the same tab. If you want to make the link open in a new tab, use the `target` attribute with a value of `_blank`.

Example:

```html
<a href="your link here" target="_blank">Your text here</a>
```

:::tip Tip
If you're linking an external website, __always__ put `http://` or `https://` before the link. If you do not do this, the link will take you to a folder or file in your website.
